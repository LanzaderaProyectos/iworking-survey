    At Laboratorios Rubi√≥, we are deeply committed to complying with the best practices of the pharmaceutical industry.
    Also, we strive to achieve the highest standards in terms of social and environmental performance, accountability,
    and transparency. Our logic transcends the idea that we should only measure results in economic and financial terms.
    As a company, we pursue a positive impact in every decision, to contribute to transforming and benefiting all
    people, communities, and the planet. Our firm belief that our actions today will help to shape a better world for
    the next generations guides our steps.

    As we aim to ensure that, as a business, we are a force for good, we would like to know whether our partners,
    clients, suppliers, and other stakeholders are also committed to being part of a global economy that benefits all.
    <br>
    For this reason, we would like to ask you to complete the following questionnaire, and we want to assure you that
    all the information gathered will be treated as confidential.
