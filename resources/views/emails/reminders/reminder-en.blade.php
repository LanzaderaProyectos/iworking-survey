    To whom it may concern,
</p>
<p>
    At Laboratorios Rubi√≥, we are deeply committed to complying with the best practices of the pharmaceutical industry.
    Also, we strive to achieve the highest standards in terms of social and environmental performance, accountability,
    and transparency. Our logic transcends the idea that we should only measure results in economic and financial terms.
    As a company, we pursue a positive impact in every decision, to contribute to transforming and benefiting all
    people, communities, and the planet. Our firm belief that our actions today will help to shape a better world for
    the next generations guides our steps.

<p>
    As our goal is to ensure that as a company we are a force for good, we would like to know if our partners,
    customers, suppliers, and other stakeholders are also committed to being part of a global economy that benefits
    everyone. For this reason, we would like to remind you that it is of vital importance to complete the following
    questionnaire which we sent you last 2022. All the information collected will be treated confidentially. We need you
    to answer this questionnaire before {{ $monthName }} {{ $day }}, so we hope and ask for your collaboration.
</p>
<p>
    Thank you in advance for your time.
    <br>
    Best regards.
